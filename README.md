# ReactCourse--Expense-App
My first app wich i build during React-course
You can just simply add some expenses aside from those that are in the program already and filter them by date , and i have some pills that are showing the month in wich u spend the most money.
Here you can find my Netlify deployment : florin-expense-app.netlify.app
